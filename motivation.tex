\chapter{Motivation}
\section{Use of online tutorials}
Exploring reasons behind why people use tutorials revealed
that people use tutorials to solve a specific problem. This
is different from the general assumption that tutorial authors
and researchers make: that people use tutorials to learn.The
distinction between solving a problem and learning is that
the problem solver finds only the necessary information to
overcome the obstacle. A learner is expected to retain material
more completely and for a longer period of time. Typically,
tutorial users simply remember the location of important
content and then refer back to it when they need it again. To
tackle traditional role of tutorials as a learning tool is where
my project comes with a huge role to play.

\section{Implementation}
Many times people find the topics or concepts on the web
but face problem in implementing it through codes this project
focuses on implementation part of concepts.

\section{Avoid Destructive criticism}
Tutorials eliminate the possibility of destructive criticism by
offering no opportunity for personal interaction.

\section{Self Paced Learning}
By use of tutorials people can learn at their own pace and
can review and revisit as many times as they need.

\section{Learning Recent Technologies In Web}
This project is helping me to learn a lot of things including
Python language and its object oriented properties, use of
MVC architecture, django application framework and lots of
other things.
