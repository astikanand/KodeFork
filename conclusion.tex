\chapter{Conclusion}

We have described an natural language query
interface for databases which is interactive. Given a natural language
input we first translate it into a SQL statement and
then evaluates it against the underlying relational database. To achieve better reliability the system shows each step to transformation of input to the user. If there are ambiguities, then for each ambiguity, the system outputs multiple top ranked interpretations so that the user can choose from them. The query mechanism described in this paper has been implemented, and actual user experience gathered. Using our system, even naive users are
able to accomplish logically complex query tasks.
