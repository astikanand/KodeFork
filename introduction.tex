KodeFork is an online learning web portal.It provides different courses in computer science with section and topic wise tutorials. Each concept is explained with examples and codes. It then provides a series of problem related to that concept. It has its own question and answering community where people can ask and answer questions. It also provides people with articles on latest topics and technologies and encourage them to write their own articles on the portal. People can also write their code in various different programming languages, compile and run online using editor and compiler provided by the portal. 

\section{Problem Statement}
To develop a user friendly online learning portal and a
question and answering community.

\section{Literature Survey}
Stack exchange community: They focus only on the pro-
blems related to Computer Science and other fields are not
taken in account. Quora: They give a freedom to ask any
kind of question but people are not so focused for learning
and helping,they tend to ask questions related to personal
lives and all that. Tutorialspoint community: They are doing
good as far as delivering contents but they donâ€™t provide
community for discussions which derails people if they are
stuck. All above have very good interface and they too make
use of online portal to provide quality learning.But this project
insures a complete learning platform where people can start
from scratch and go on learning and developing skills.
